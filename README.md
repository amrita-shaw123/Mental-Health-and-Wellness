# Mental-Health-and-Wellness
The Student Mental Health & Wellness Tracker is a web-based application designed to support students in managing their emotional well-being. The app allows users to track their daily mood by selecting how they feel—Happy, Sad, or Stressed. Based on the selected mood, the system provides personalized motivational messages and stress-relief tips, creating a supportive and empathetic user experience.

The application uses JavaScript DOM manipulation to dynamically update content only after the user shares their mood, ensuring a natural and meaningful interaction flow. To maintain progress over time, localStorage is used to store mood data, allowing users to view their emotional trends even after refreshing or reopening the website.

A visual progress chart is implemented using the HTML5 Canvas API, which displays the frequency of different moods. This helps students gain awareness of their emotional patterns and encourages self-reflection. The clean and calming user interface is designed to reduce stress and promote positivity.

Overall, this project demonstrates strong social impact, effective use of core JavaScript concepts, and a student-centric design, making it suitable for academic evaluation and real-world application.
